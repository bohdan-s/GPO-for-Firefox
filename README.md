GPO-for-Firefox
===============

Sorry for the lack of documentation, will work on that!

Basically install the ADMX and ADML files to your Group Policy Store,
Add the firefox_gpo.vbs to the logon script.

Set the settings in Group Policy under Machine > Adminstrator Templates > Applications > Mozilla > Firefox

The settings are the same name as the about:settings config.
Will wrok on notes and making it more user friendly in later releases.

As it is now can set Homepage, Stop auto updates and set Proxy Settings.
